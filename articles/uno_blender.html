                <h3>720 cards of pure UNO chaos</h3>
                <p>This is a project that I've been working on for a little while. 
                    It's a combination of seven different UNO variants, three other games, and the four UNO add-on packs. 
                    I actually started working on this before Massacre Mansion's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiC8IsjddD5WZbH3bcuuC8K3akPS08nsb">Uno Amalgam</a> (Chemicards), but my project combines actual UNO decks instead of creating custom cards.</p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    You probably won't need to shuffle the deck unless this is your first game. 
                    Place the Direction Tracker and Link Cards in the center of the table and give each player a Power Card. 
                    Then, deal every player seven cards. 
                    Finally, flip over the top card of the deck to form the discard pile. 
                    If that card is an action card, then flip over more cards until there is a non-action card on top of the discard pile. 
                    Now the game can begin!
                </p>

                <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Each player takes turns matching cards from their hand to the top card of the discard pile. 
                    Players are able to match by color, number, or any action symbol. 
                    Card modifiers are a separate property and <strong>cannot</strong> be matched to. 
                    For example, if the shown card is a Blue 8 with a Flip modifier, then the active player must play either a Blue card or an 8 card. 
                    Wild cards may be played on any card unless a play restriction would prevent a player from doing so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the active player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the deck. 
                    If that card can be played, it may be played. 
                    Otherwise, the card is kept, and the next person in turn order becomes the active player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever a player's hand size changes to exactly one card, that player must call out "UNO!" 
                    If another player says "UNO" before them, then the player with one card <strong>immediately</strong> draws two cards as a penalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of every turn, if a player has no cards in their hand, or if there is only one player remaining, then that player wins the game. 
                    On the other hand, if a player has 25 or more cards in their hand, they are eliminated. 
                    Eliminated players can no longer take any turns, and are considered out of the game. Eliminated players' hands are burned (placed at the bottom of the discard pile).
                </p>

                <h3>Tempo</h3>
                <p>
                    During their turn, players must play a number of cards equal to the current tempo. 
                    The tempo starts at 1 and may increase from Speed Up effects. 
                    If a player is unable to play enough cards to meet the tempo, they play what they can and then draw cards equal to the tempo. Then, the tempo resets back to 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each card played must match the previous card. 
                    Action cards only take effect if they are the last card played on your turn.
                </p>

                <h3>Jump-Ins</h3>
                <p>
                    During any player's turn, if you have a card that matches the shown card both in color and number/symbol, then you may play that card out of turn. 
                    Modifiers do not have to match. 
                    Wild cards are considered their own color for the purposes of jump-ins. 
                    If a jump-in is successful, you immediately become the active player and begin resolving card effects. 
                    However, if you play an illegal card out of turn, then you must take that card back and draw one card as a penalty.
                </p>

                <h3>Stacking</h3>
                <p>
                    Whenever a Draw or Stack card is played, a penalty is added to the stack, and a play restriction comes into effect. 
                    During each player's turn, if there is a stack, then that player may draw cards equal to the stack's penalty to end the stack. 
                    If they do so, then that player's turn ends. 
                    If they choose not to, then that player <strong>must</strong> play a card according to the restriction (they cannot draw like they would if they didn't have a match).
                </p>

                <h3>Flexing</h3>
                <p>
                    Some cards have two sides: a "regular" side and a "flex" side. 
                    If your Power Card is green, you may play the flex side of a card by flipping your Power Card to red. 
                    When you are matching to a flex card in the discard pile, always match to the primary color and symbol (the "regular" side). 
                    If every player's Power Card is red, then all players flip theirs back to green.
                </p>

                <h2>Additional Rules and Clarifications</h2>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>There are no challenges.</p>

                <h3>Modifiers</h3>
                <p>
                    Flex side symbols are not considered modifiers. 
                    Modifiers are not counted as part of a card's identity. 
                    There are five modifiers:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Flip</strong> (Flex)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flip your Power Card, regardless of its current state.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Trade</strong> (No Mercy)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trade hands with another player of your choice.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Pass</strong> (No Mercy)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All players pass their hand to the next player in the current turn order.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Swap</strong> (Teams)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose another player. You and that player both pass each other 1 card.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Speed Up</strong> (Speed Pack)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The tempo increases by 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Targeted Draw vs Reverse Draw</h3>
                <p>
                    Targeted Draw and Draw are considered different symbols with different effects. 
                    Targeted Draw cards do not create or add to a stack when played. 
                    However, a Reverse Draw card has both the Reverse symbol and the Draw symbol, and may be played while there is a stack. 
                    Keep in mind that the Reverse symbol will activate before the Draw symbol.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Stacking and Jump-Ins</h3>
                <p>
                    Players may jump-in even when there is a stack, however any card played must still respect the play restriction. 
                    If an illegal card is played, the active player does not change and the stack is unaffected.
                </p>

                <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                <p>
                    Restrictions limit what cards are playable beyond just matching the current color or symbol. 
                    For example, a color restriction forces players to only play cards of a specific color. 
                    If at least one property of a card matches the restriction, then that card is eligible to be matched. 
                    In other words, played cards have to match the top card of the discard pile <strong>and</strong> the restriction.
                </p>

                <h3 id="mini-tech">Mini Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    The secondary side of a flex card can be played on a mini-pile if its color matches the restriction. 
                    If a flex side is played, the next player must play a card matching the primary side while still following the mini-pile restriction. 
                    (Wild cards can also be played because they are also part of the mini-pile restriction.)
                </p>

                <h3>Event Order</h3>
                <p>
                    When a card is played, these events happen in the following order: 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Announce Flexing (if card can be flexed)</li>
                    <li>Select Color (if card has black background)</li>
                    <li>Perform Actions (if card has action symbols)</li>
                    <li>Activate Modifiers (if card has modifiers)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Skip the Perform Actions event if the card is <strong>not</strong> the last card played for tempo. 
                    If a card has multiple actions, perform them from left to right as they appear in the card's name. 
                    Once all events for the last played card are finished, the active player changes to the next player in the turn order. 
                </p>
                <p>A jump-in may not be performed while any of these events are unresolved.</p>
