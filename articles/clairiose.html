                <h1>Clairiose Rules</h1>
                <h3>A card game about clairvoyance and lying</h3>
                <p>Hey everyone! I invented a new card game. It's like a combination of Cheat and Switch.</p>
                <p>This game is played with a standard 52 card deck, plus two Jokers. The goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.</p>

                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>Deal each player 7 cards. 
                    The rest of the cards will form the deck. 
                    Turn over the top card of the deck to form the discard pile and begin the game. 
                    If no more cards remain in the deck, shuffle the discard pile into the deck.</p>
                <p>Each player takes turns playing cards from their hand that matches the suit or number of the top card of the discard pile. 
                    If a player is unable to play a card (or chooses not to), they must draw the top card of the deck. If that card is playable, they may play it. 
                    If not, then play passes to the next player.</p>
                <p>Whenever you have one card in your hand, you must call out "Clairiose". 
                    Failure to say "Clairiose" correctly results in a penalty of two cards. 
                    Additionally, <strong>if you play a Joker as your last card, you instantly lose</strong>.</p>
                <p>Some cards have special effects when played:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you play an Ace, the turn order reverses.</li>
                    <li>If you play a 2, the next player draws 2 cards unless they play another 2, in which case the penalty stacks and is passed to the next player.</li>
                    <li>If you play an 8, the next player misses their turn.</li>
                    <li>Jokers are wild cards and can be played on any other card, however they also have the additional effect of flipping the deck and discard pile. The next player is allowed to play any card from their hand.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While the deck is face up and discard pile face down, players play their cards face down and say the name of the card they just played (or draw face up cards from the deck). 
                    If a player believes another player has played an illegal card (does not match the card they said they played), then they may challenge them. 
                    The top card of the discard pile is then turned face up. 
                    If the card has been illegally played, it returns to the suspect, who then draws a card to end their turn (they may not play the card drawn). 
                    If the card played is legal, then the challenger draws a card instead. The card is turned back face down if it is legal, and play continues to the next player.</p>
