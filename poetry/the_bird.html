                <h1>The Bird</h1>
                <h2>A Golden Shovel after Gwendolyn Brooks' "Beverly Hills, Chicago"</h2>
                <p>A bird! We stop to see <strong>it</strong>.</p>
                <p>But we all see it for what it really <strong>is</strong>.</p>
                <p>At first, we see it through our eyes <strong>only</strong>.</p>
                <p>However, it must be stopped, it is not <strong>natural</strong>.</p>
                <p>We do not want to stay any longer, I disagree with <strong>that</strong>.</p>
                <p>For the bird is spying, just as <strong>we</strong>.</p>
                <p>I set my weapon, as we all <strong>should</strong>.</p>
                <p>Through the scope, I get a good <strong>look</strong>.</p>
                <p>My finger stealthily slides across the trigger, <strong>and</strong></p>
                <p>Huzzah! The drone is dead. We stop to <strong>look</strong>.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I originally wrote this poem for an assignment in 11th grade. I'm not sure what was going through my head when I wrote it. What I do remember is that my English teacher enjoyed it so much she displayed it on the classroom wall.</p>
